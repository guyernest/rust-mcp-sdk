# Phase 116 — Deferred Items

Out-of-scope discoveries logged during execution. Each names the plan that found it and a
proposed owner. Nothing here was fixed by the finding plan — that is the point of the file.

## D-116-EX — No plan in Phase 116 owns CLAUDE.md's ALWAYS-**EXAMPLE** requirement

**Found during:** `116-02` (Task 2), while checking CLAUDE.md's "ALWAYS Requirements for New
Features" against the phase's plan set.

**Finding.** CLAUDE.md § "ALWAYS Requirements for New Features (MANDATORY)" lists four
non-negotiables for every new feature: FUZZ, PROPERTY, UNIT and **EXAMPLE**
(`cargo run --example feature_name`, "must include real-world usage scenario"). Three of the four
have a named owner in this phase:

| ALWAYS requirement | Owner | Status |
|---|---|---|
| PROPERTY | `116-02` (`tests/oauth_iss_validation.rs`, four RFC-derived proptest blocks) | done |
| UNIT | `116-02` (27 integration + 8 inline) and every later source plan | in progress |
| FUZZ | `116-08` — `fuzz/fuzz_targets/oauth_authorization_response.rs` names `validate_authorization_response` explicitly | planned |
| **EXAMPLE** | **none** | **unowned** |

Measured: `grep -n 'examples/' .planning/phases/116-auth-hardening-seps/116-*-PLAN.md` returns one
hit, in `116-01`, and it refers to the pre-existing `examples/s51_v2_tasks_agent.rs` build failure
recorded in the baselines — not to authoring an example.
`grep -n 'cargo run --example\|EXAMPLE demonstration\|examples/oauth'` across all sixteen plans
returns **zero** hits. No plan's `files_modified` names anything under `examples/`.

**Why `116-02` did not just add one.** The plan's Task 2 `<files>` list is explicit and closed
(`src/shared/oauth_validation.rs`, `src/shared/mod.rs`, `src/lib.rs`,
`tests/oauth_iss_validation.rs`). An unowned example is neither a bug in this plan's output, nor
missing critical functionality for correctness/security, nor a blocker to completing the task — so
it is out of scope under the executor's scope boundary rather than an auto-fix.

**What partially discharges it today.** The module ships five executable rustdoc `# Examples`
doctests (module-level end-to-end, plus `AuthorizationRequestRecord::new`,
`validate_authorization_response`, `parse_iss_env_value` and `iss_presence_from`), all passing
under `cargo test --features full,oauth --doc oauth_validation`. Those are runnable demonstrations,
but they are not `cargo run --example`, and `make validate-always`'s `test-examples` step does not
reach them.

**Proposed owner:** `116-15` (the phase-closing plan, which already owns the ALWAYS/A9 evidence
roll-up) or `116-13`. The natural artifact is a single `examples/` binary that walks a complete
hardened flow — build the record, validate a good callback, then show the four typed refusals
(`is_iss_mismatch`, `is_state_mismatch`, duplicate parameter, oversize query) — since it needs no
network and no `oauth` feature and would therefore also serve as the phase's user-facing README
snippet.

**Do not book "ALWAYS requirements satisfied" for Phase 116 until this is closed or explicitly
waived in writing.**

## D-116-DOC — `make doc-check`'s 28-error baseline is fragile against outer-doc'd modules

**Found during:** `116-02` (Task 2). Recorded because the next two plans (`116-04`, `116-05`) create
`src/shared/` modules the same way and will hit the same trap.

**Finding.** A module that carries BOTH an outer `///` rationale on its `pub mod` declaration in
`src/shared/mod.rs` (which the plans require, so nobody "tidies" a `cfg` onto it) AND an inner `//!`
module doc has its merged documentation resolved in the **declaring** module's scope. Every
unqualified intra-doc link in the inner block then fails with "no item named `X` in scope", and
`make doc-check` runs `RUSTDOCFLAGS="-D warnings"`, so each one is a hard error.

`116-02` added four such errors on its first pass (28 → 32): three unqualified `IssPresence*` links
in the module-doc table, plus one link to a genuinely non-existent path (`crate::client::OAuthConfig`
— the type lives at `crate::client::oauth::OAuthConfig` behind a feature gate). Both were fixed in
the same task and the count returned to exactly 28, but only because the plan happened to require
running `doc-check`.

**Guidance for `116-04` and `116-05`:** fully qualify every intra-doc link in an inner `//!` block
of a module whose declaration carries an outer `///`, and do not link items that live behind a
feature gate the ungated module must not assume — use a plain code span instead. Run `make doc-check`
and diff the `^error` count against 28 **before** committing, not after.

**Proposed owner:** informational; no fix required. `116-15` may wish to fold the rule into the
phase's written conventions.
