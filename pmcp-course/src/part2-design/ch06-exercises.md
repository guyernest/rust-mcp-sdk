## Exercises

1. **[Prompt Design Workshop](./ch06-ex01-prompt-design.md)** ⭐⭐ Intermediate (25 min)
   - Design structured analysis prompts
   - Create safe data modification workflows
   - Build context-setting prompts for exploration

## Key Concepts to Practice

- **Prompts as User Control**: Users explicitly choose workflows by invoking prompts
- **Numbered Steps**: AI follows explicit, numbered steps more reliably
- **Guard Rails**: Preview, confirm, then execute for dangerous operations
- **Tool References**: Name specific tools in prompts so AI knows what to use

## Resources vs Tools Quick Reference

| Use Resources For | Use Tools For |
|-------------------|---------------|
| Schema and structure | Parameterized queries |
| Configuration | Write operations |
| Reference data | External integrations |
| Documentation | Computed results |
