This course assumes familiarity with several foundational concepts. Review the areas below to ensure you're ready to get the most from the material.

## Knowledge Prerequisites

### Rust Fundamentals

You should be comfortable with:

- **Ownership and borrowing** - Understanding Rust's memory model
- **Traits and generics** - Implementing and using traits
- **Error handling** - Using `Result`, `Option`, and the `?` operator
- **Async/await** - Basic understanding of async Rust
- **Cargo** - Creating projects, adding dependencies, running tests

**Recommended resources:**
- [The Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
- [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/)
- [Async Rust Book](https://rust-lang.github.io/async-book/)

### HTTP and APIs

For Parts III-V (deployment and security), familiarity with at least one cloud platform is helpful:

- **AWS** - Lambda, API Gateway, IAM basics
- **Cloudflare** - Workers, Wrangler CLI
- **Google Cloud** - Cloud Run, Container Registry

Don't worry if you're new to cloud deployment - we cover everything step by step.

## Environment Setup

For installation and tool setup, complete the **Environment Setup Exercise** at the start of Chapter 2:

- [Exercise: Environment Setup](./part1-foundations/ch02-ex00-setup.md)

This interactive exercise will guide you through installing Rust, cargo-pmcp, and setting up your MCP client.

## Ready?

If you're comfortable with Rust basics and have completed the environment setup, you're ready to start building production MCP servers.
