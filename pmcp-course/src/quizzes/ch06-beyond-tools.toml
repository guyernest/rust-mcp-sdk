answer.answer = "Resources provide stable, addressable data; Tools perform actions that may have side effects"
context = """
Resources are like bookmarks - stable data with a URI identity (db://schema).
Tools are like form submissions - actions with potential side effects. The AI
treats them differently: reading resources freely for context, but calling tools
deliberately to accomplish goals.

prompt.prompt = "Why are Prompts described as the 'primary mechanism for user-controlled workflows'?"
prompt.distractors = [
    "Prompts are faster than tools",
    "Prompts bypass AI decision-making entirely",
    "Prompts are required by MCP protocol"
]
answer.answer = "Users explicitly invoke prompts to select a workflow, giving them predictable control over AI behavior"
context = """
Unlike tools (AI decides when to use) and resources (AI reads for context),
prompts are explicitly invoked by users. When a user types /quarterly-analysis,
they're choosing that specific workflow. This gives users control rather than
hoping the AI picks the right approach.

[[questions]]
type = "MultipleChoice"
prompt.prompt = "What should you use for database schema information - a Resource or a Tool?"
prompt.distractors = [
    "A tool called 'get_schema'",
    "Either one works equally well",
    "A prompt that fetches the schema"
]
answer.answer = "A Resource like 'db://schema' because schemas are stable, addressable data"
context = """
Schema information is stable reference data with a clear identity - perfect for
a resource. The AI can read db://schema proactively for context without counting
it as an 'action'. A tool called 'get_schema' implies an action, but reading
schema is just gathering information.

[[questions]]
type = "MultipleChoice"
prompt.prompt = "In prompt design, why should steps be explicitly numbered with specific tool references?"
prompt.distractors = [
    "Numbered steps are required by MCP protocol",
    "It reduces the prompt's token count",
    "It prevents the prompt from being cached"
]
answer.answer = "AI follows explicit numbered steps better and knows exactly which tools to use at each step"
context = """
Vague prompts like 'analyze the data' leave AI guessing which tools to use.
Explicit steps like '1. Read db://schema, 2. Use sales_query to get revenue,
3. Use sales_aggregate for totals' give clear guidance. The AI executes the
prescribed workflow reliably.

prompt.prompt = "What is the rule of thumb for deciding between Resources and Tools?"
prompt.distractors = [
    "Use resources for anything JSON-formatted",
    "Use tools for anything requiring parameters",
    "Use resources for read-only, tools for write"
]
answer.answer = "If you'd bookmark it, use a Resource; if you'd submit a form, use a Tool"
context = """
The bookmark/form metaphor captures the distinction well. Bookmarks point to
stable, addressable content (resources). Forms submit data and trigger actions
(tools). Database schema is a bookmark. Query execution is a form submission.

[[questions]]
type = "MultipleChoice"
prompt.prompt = "Why include guard rails in prompts for data modification workflows?"
prompt.distractors = [
    "To improve query performance",
    "Because MCP requires confirmation for all tools",
    "To reduce the number of tool calls"
]
answer.answer = "To ensure the AI shows affected records, explains changes, and asks for confirmation before destructive operations"
context = """
Guard rails in prompts like 'show affected records, explain changes, ask for
confirmation' protect against accidental modifications. The prompt forces the
AI to follow a safe workflow: preview → explain → confirm → execute. Without
this, the AI might execute immediately.

prompt.prompt = "In Claude Desktop, how do users invoke MCP prompts?"
answer.answer = "slash commands"
answer.alternatives = ["/commands", "/ commands", "Slash commands", "/", "slash command"]
context = """
Claude Desktop exposes MCP prompts as slash commands. Users type /quarterly-analysis
or /customer-health-check to invoke specific workflows. Other clients may show
prompts differently - VS Code uses command palette, ChatGPT shows conversation starters.

    "It reduces schema size"

answer.answer = "Telling AI what a tool is NOT for helps prevent misuse - 'Cannot modify data, use sales_admin for updates'"
context = """
Sometimes it's helpful to say what a tool can't do. 'sales_query: Read-only.
CANNOT modify data - use sales_admin. For reports, use sales_report (faster).'
This prevents AI from using the wrong tool and guides it to the correct alternative.

prompt.prompt = "In multi-step workflows, why should tools explicitly document ID relationships between output and input?"
prompt.distractors = [
    "To reduce network bandwidth",
    "Because IDs must be globally unique",
    "To enable database joins"
]
answer.answer = "So AI knows that 'customer_id' from sales_top_customers works as input to order_history"
context = """
When chaining tools, AI needs to know how outputs connect to inputs. Documenting
'Returns customer_id for use with order_history, customer_details tools' explicitly
tells the AI how to chain them. Without this, AI might use wrong field names or
incompatible IDs.

answer.answer = "Orchestration tools coordinate multiple operations internally; Guided prompts direct AI to call tools sequentially"
context = """
An orchestration tool like 'customer_analysis' gathers orders, support tickets,
and engagement internally - AI calls once. A guided prompt instructs AI:
'Step 1: call order_history, Step 2: call support_tickets...' - AI calls each
tool. Orchestration hides complexity; guided prompts show the workflow.
