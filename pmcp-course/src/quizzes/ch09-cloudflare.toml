answer.answer = "V8 isolates that spin up in microseconds with shared V8 engine overhead"
context = """
Workers uses V8 isolates, not containers. Multiple isolates share one V8 engine
instance, eliminating per-request engine startup. An isolate is just a JavaScript
execution context with its own memory - creating one takes microseconds. WASM
modules are also pre-compiled, further reducing startup time.

context = """
Rust compiles to wasm32-unknown-unknown for WebAssembly targets. This produces
a .wasm binary that V8 can execute. Install with: rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown.
The 'unknown-unknown' indicates no specific OS or vendor - it's a bare WASM target.

prompt.prompt = "Why can't standard async runtimes like tokio be used in Cloudflare Workers?"
prompt.distractors = [
    "Workers only supports synchronous code execution",
    "tokio requires more than 128MB of memory",
    "Workers uses JavaScript for all async operations"
]
answer.answer = "tokio relies on system calls (epoll/kqueue) that don't exist in the WASM sandbox"
context = """
WASM runs in a sandboxed environment without access to OS system calls. tokio's
I/O reactor uses epoll (Linux) or kqueue (macOS) for async I/O - these don't
exist in WASM. Instead, Workers provides async through JavaScript promises that
bridge to the V8 event loop. Use wasm-bindgen-futures for async in Workers.

answer.answer = "KV (Workers KV) for globally distributed key-value storage with eventual consistency"
context = """
Workers KV stores key-value pairs replicated across Cloudflare's edge network.
Reads are fast (~10ms) from any edge location. Writes are eventually consistent
(~60 seconds to propagate globally). Use KV for caching tool results, session
data, or configuration. Bind in wrangler.toml with [[kv_namespaces]].

]
answer.answer = "128 MB for both free and paid plans"
context = """
Workers have a hard 128MB memory limit - this cannot be increased on any plan.
This constraint requires careful design: streaming large datasets instead of
buffering, using external storage (KV, R2) for large objects, and avoiding
memory-heavy dependencies. Rust's zero-cost abstractions help stay within limits.

WASM requires crate-type = ['cdylib'] in Cargo.toml. This produces a dynamic
library with C-compatible exports that wasm-bindgen can process. The resulting
.wasm file contains exported functions that JavaScript can call. Don't use 'bin'
or 'lib' - they won't produce the correct WASM output format.

Hyperdrive connects Workers to external PostgreSQL, MySQL, or other databases.
It maintains connection pools at Cloudflare's edge, eliminating per-request
connection overhead. Queries are routed through Cloudflare's network, and
results can be cached. Configure with [[hyperdrive]] in wrangler.toml.

    "Workers charge per KB of deployed code",

answer.answer = "Larger WASM binaries take longer to parse and compile, increasing cold start times"
context = """
V8 must parse and compile WASM on first load. A 100KB binary parses in ~1ms;
a 3MB binary takes ~12ms. While still fast, keeping binaries under 1MB ensures
consistent sub-20ms cold starts. Use opt-level='s', LTO, and strip symbols.
The worker size limit is 10MB compressed, but smaller is faster.
