# Quiz: Database MCP Servers

prompt.prompt = "Why should MCP database servers only allow SELECT queries by default?"
prompt.distractors = [
    "SELECT queries are faster than other queries",
    "Other query types aren't supported by MCP",
    "SELECT is the only SQL command that returns data"
]
answer.answer = "To prevent accidental or malicious data modification"
context = """
Security is paramount in enterprise MCP servers. By restricting to SELECT queries,
you prevent users (or AI) from accidentally or intentionally modifying or deleting data.
Write operations should require explicit, separate tools with proper authorization.

prompt.distractors = [
    "A way to speed up database queries",
    "A technique to compress SQL statements",
    "A method for caching database results"
]
answer.answer = "An attack where malicious SQL is inserted into queries"
context = """
SQL injection occurs when user input is directly concatenated into SQL queries.
An attacker can craft input that changes the query's meaning, potentially
accessing unauthorized data or modifying the database. Always use parameterized queries.

sqlx is a popular async SQL crate that provides compile-time checked queries,
connection pooling, and support for PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite.

type = "MultipleChoice"
prompt.prompt = "When should you use a Resource instead of a Tool for data access?"
prompt.distractors = [
    "When the data is large",
    "When the data changes frequently",
    "When you need to execute complex queries"
]
answer.answer = "When you want to provide a stable URI for a specific piece of data"
context = """
Resources are best for structured, addressable data with stable URIs (like db://customers/123).
Tools are better for dynamic queries where the user specifies parameters.
Resources enable caching and direct linking in AI conversations.

prompt.prompt = "What should you always add to database queries to prevent memory issues?"
prompt.distractors = [
    "ORDER BY clause",
    "DISTINCT keyword",
    "GROUP BY clause"
]
answer.answer = "LIMIT clause"
context = """
Always add a LIMIT clause to prevent queries from returning millions of rows
and exhausting server memory. A reasonable default (e.g., 100-1000 rows) with
a maximum limit protects both the server and the user experience.
