//! `pmcp-workbook-compiler` — the OFFLINE Excel→MCP compiler.
//!
//! This crate runs the build-time pipeline that turns a governed Excel workbook
//! into a tested, versioned, deterministic served bundle:
//! ingest → lint → manifest synth → formula parse → DAG compile →
//! penny-reconcile → artifact emit → promote-time gate.
//!
//! # The purity boundary (the milestone's #1 trap)
//!
//! This is the ONE crate in the workspace where the Excel reader
//! (`umya-spreadsheet`, plus its transitive `quick-xml`/`zip`) is allowed. The
//! reader is confined to the [`ingest`] and [`provenance`] modules; no umya type
//! leaks across the crate boundary, and the served-tree crates
//! (`pmcp-workbook-runtime`, `pmcp-workbook-dialect`, `pmcp-server-toolkit`)
//! NEVER link it. The Makefile `purity-check` gate POSITIVELY asserts umya IS
//! here and is ABSENT everywhere served.
//!
//! # Re-export, don't re-declare (the keystone)
//!
//! Every shared model/IR/hash/changelog/finding/rounding type is re-exported
//! from [`pmcp_workbook_runtime`] (and the dialect contract from
//! [`pmcp_workbook_dialect`]) — NEVER re-declared. A second copy of
//! `Manifest`/`ChangeClass`/`WHITELIST` would make the served loader and the
//! `diff_version` tool read a DIFFERENT definition than the compiler emits.

// Compiler/clippy-enforced panic-freedom on the library value path (copied
// verbatim from pmcp-workbook-runtime). Test code constructs fixtures freely.
